# Rainfall-Prediction

Here are four key points about a rainfall prediction model using AI/ML:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: The model uses historical weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and previous rainfall records, which are cleaned and normalized for training.

Feature Selection and Engineering: Relevant features are selected or engineered to ensure the model focuses on weather patterns and seasonal trends influencing rainfall, improving prediction accuracy.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Commonly used algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), or deep learning models like LSTMs, which are capable of capturing temporal dependencies.

Evaluation and Deployment: The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and then deployed via web or mobile apps to deliver predictions for agricultural or urban planning purposes.
